# finn is (not) napari

The motile tracker started as a [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin. However, as we developed more advanced features, we found ourselves frequently wanting to adapt the core code of napari, remove features that were not compatible with our applicaton, change layer controls, etc. finn started as a fork of napari, then a complete copy, and we expect it will continually diverge until it becomes an independent viewer optimized for displaying cell tracking data.

Many thanks to the napari community for providing an excellent starting point and tons of great feedback and assistance!
