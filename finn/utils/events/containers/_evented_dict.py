class EventedDict(TypedMutableMapping[_K, _T]):
    """Mutable dictionary that emits events when altered.

    This class is designed to behave exactly like builtin ``dict``, but
    will emit events before and after all mutations (addition, removal, and
    changing).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Mapping, optional
        Dictionary to initialize the class with.
    basetype : type of sequence of types, optional
        Type of the element in the dictionary.

    Events
    ------
    changing (key: K)
        emitted before an item at ``key`` is changed
    changed (key: K, old_value: T, value: T)
        emitted when item at ``key`` is changed from ``old_value`` to ``value``
    adding (key: K)
        emitted before an item is added to the dictionary with ``key``
    added (key: K, value: T)
        emitted after ``value`` was added to the dictionary with ``key``
    removing (key: K)
        emitted before ``key`` is removed from the dictionary
    removed (key: K, value: T)
        emitted after ``key`` was removed from the dictionary
    updated (key, K, value: T)
        emitted after ``value`` of ``key`` was changed. Only implemented by
        subclasses to give them an option to trigger some update after ``value``
        was changed and this class did not register it. This can be useful if
        the ``basetype`` is not an evented object.
